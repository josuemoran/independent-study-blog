# Databases are Hard

## But Why Do I Find Them So Difficultâ€‹?

After delving into the world of databases, I had thought I knew what to do, and how to make my Puppr app. Turns out, I was completely wrong. I decided to learn **SQL** rather than **ActiveRecord**, and the syntax was probably the biggest challenge for me. It's not that hard if you think about it, but the problem for me was that, it's a new language I have to learn, and it's not like HTML or Ruby, where those are more logic based. I thought, it would be a brighter idea to create something small with SQL first, rather than implementing the little knowledge I have now, because I do plan to get this out to the public; and if I have small bugs in my code or can't protect from **[SQL Injections]("https://www.acunetix.com/websitesecurity/sql-injection/")**, then that is a **HUGE** security risk for the users signed up. 

## My MVP

What is an **MVP**, you're probably asking. Well, in my software engineering class, an MVP refers to the **"Minimum Viable Product"**, meaning that as long as it works and you can build upon that in the future, then you're in a good place. As of right now, I have used a template from **[Bootstrap]("http://getbootstrap.com")** known as **[Freelancer]("https://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/freelancer/")**, since it's simple material-esqu design is perfect for what envisioned. I thought it would be a lot simpler if I worked on the front end using a template and then being able to spend the next 7 weeks working on the back end, since I would have something to work with. 

I think I'm really happy at where I'm at with my build. I even decided to make a logo for Puppr, when I decided to take a break from coding, and it wasn't that hard. The logo consists of two basic shapes really, circles and triangles. This is still my first draft of it, so I still need to smooth out any rough edges, but I'll worry about that when I plan on releasing a build to the public.



## Takeaways

The only real takeaway I have today is that, do something you're passionate for, and by that I mean, if you're planning on doing a build for 9 weeks, make sure you get excited every time you see the code, and can't wait to finish, because it is something you're really proud of.
