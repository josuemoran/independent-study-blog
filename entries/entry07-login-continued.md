# Entry 7: Logins CONTINUED

## Welcome back Puppr!
###  Im working on Puppr again, woohoo!
#### What have I been working on?

Well, as of right now, not much, except re-thinking my login screen.
While looking into how I would create my login screen i came across this [tutorial](http://www.developerdrive.com/2013/03/how-to-create-a-beautiful-login-form/) and liked how it looked. For Puppr I'd like to develop a material design app, so this is close enough.

## How am I creating the actual login

With the help of Flat Iron Curriculms, I've been doing their 'labs' for actually working with AR and how to install it. The two I'll be linking are [Migrations](https://github.com/learn-co-students/activerecord-migrations-pc-jastor-120215) and thier [Crud Lab](https://github.com/learn-co-students/activerecord-crud-v-000).

I've also been following along on a seperate workspace, another Rails tutorial, because Codecademy was so helpful. This one was provided by [Cloud 9](http://www.railstutorial.org), the IDE I use, when I started the Rails tutorial template recently. It is the offical Rails Tutorial and includes everything, the login and authentication too, simplifying my life by 40%. 

### So no, I haven't really been working on Puppr

I've just been caught up within learning and falling into learning subsections and learning about the background of other languages. I don't mind, because come the time when I'll be fully developing Puppr, I would be able to do a lot more than create a login page.

### I'm feeling more and more like a full-stack developer everyday
Even though I belive that it is extremley difficult to become one, and am part with the side of Stack Overflow that no one truly is a fullstack dev, being the company should always hire a front and back end dev instead of one dev.

## Takeaways

Don't be afraid to learn more because you think time is running out. I have less than a week to finish my MVP for Puppr, but I am confident that with so many tutorials, I'll be able to finish it in no time.
