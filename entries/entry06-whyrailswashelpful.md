# Entry 6: Thank You For Nothing

## Why CodeCademy sucks

I've been trying to learn Ruby on Rails there and I genuinely hate it. None of the tests work, nothing works. I litterally copy and paste the code it tells me to write and it doesn't work! 
I click "give me code" after it realizes I've been having trouble write: 
```
<div class="main">
  <div class="container">
    <h1>Hello my name is __</h1>
    <p>I make Rails apps.</p>
  </div>
</div>
```
and the code it gives me is:

```
<div class="main">
  <div class="container">
    <h1>Hello my name is __</h1>
    <p>I make Rails apps.</p>
  </div>
</div>
```
Notice any differences?
#### You wouldn't because there are none!


## Why I think CodeCademy doesn't like me

My suspicion on why it's not working is because I have a weak-moderate internet conenction at home. I have enough bandwith to sream Netflix and code with and "auto-save" function turned on. 
So why can't I just learn a lesson on Codecademy without a problem?
I don't know.
I even sent them an email talking about how great Code Academy use to be, but now Codecademy has a Pro feature for $19.99 a month.
For an underprivledged student living in New York with parents who don't understand how the internet works and doesn't want to spent $60 a month on an ISP when we can pay $15 for a student plan from my middle school that should have expired 4 years agp, Codecademy is NOT your best friend. It's not even a friend. 
You lose all the functionality of learning because you can't learn when their lessons wont even properly load and constantly say your code is wrong. Code Academy use to get me frustrated when I was 14 because of missing semi-collons, which is a rookie mistake. But now everything about it frustrates me.


## Why everyone should use Khan Academy

### First of all, it works
It loads.
The videos are beyond helpful.
The videos are also interactive.
I learned about tables there!

## Udacity is also AWESOME!

Udacity is similar to Khan, except it's designed more as a teacher teaching you the material, which is kinda exactly what Khan Academy does.
Anyways Udacity is a great resourcet too!

## Takeaways

1. Codecademy does not work for my home situation. At school it sometimes bugs up

2. Khan Academy is amazing.

3. Udacity is too.
