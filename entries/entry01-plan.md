# Entry 1: Intro / Plan

After pursuing the topics for independent study, I concluded on **Databases**. Although I've already landed on this topic a while ago when making my **[Doggo](https://github.com/josuemoran/doggo)** ruby app; this was a school project to create an interactive game within the console of ruby using classes. While making this app I had thought how cool it would be to create an application where animal shelters can make accounts for their rescue animals and people in the area can set up play-dates with the pet to potentially adopt. I called this idea Match.com for dogs because I wanted to focus on dogs mainly.

## Puppr

The name Puppr came from the idea of Match.com for dogs, when I just randomly bounced named off of my peers, and Puppr seemed to fit. Although a generic play on the "r" added to company names to sound trendy (ex: Uber, Tinder, Giftr), I fell in love with the name Puppr, and saw it as a viable product in the future.
