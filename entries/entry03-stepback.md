# Entry 3: Lets Take A Step Back

## Why I need a break from Puppr.

After being overloaded with information about SQL, I've decided I wanted to takw a step back.
Now, what does that actually entail?
For me, I want to start working on Puppr again when I have all the right tools and components to piece everything together.

#### You cannot bake a cake with half a recipe

So why try to finish Puppr so early on when I can't even finish the login screen?

## What will I be doing moving forward?

I've decided that in order to work on Puppr, I need to learn ActiveRecord. Learning SQL and how to write tables were fun and I thought it was useful, but turns out that ActiveRecord is WAAAAAYYYYY easier, because it takes out all the hard work for you. 

I essentially wasited some time learning SQL thinking it would be easier to just write the commands myself, but time is running out!

## What are the differences with SQL and ActiveRecord

THat will be covered in next week's blog, as I don't know enough to really talk about it, except that it seems easier to work with.

As of now, I can leave these helpful links for learning SQL if that is something you find interesting.

The first one is by [Microsoft](https://mva.microsoft.com/en-US/training-courses/sql-database-fundamentals-16944?l=w7qq6nAID_6805121157
) and is more of a teach along, where it is split in mini videos explaining different concepts and how to write SQL. 

This next one is by the [Stanford University](https://lagunita.stanford.edu/courses/DB/2014/SelfPaced/about) and is a self-paced course, but one that is intense because the "estimated effor" for this course is about 8-12 hours a week.

Both of these were sent to me by Raquel Cardona, the recently appointed Director of Strategic Initiatives for CS4all at the DOE.

## Takeaways
This week's takeaway is to not jump headfirst into new topics without doing enough research. I thought that databases I'd learn some SQL and I'd be done, but that was not the case, as I cannot even write SQL.
