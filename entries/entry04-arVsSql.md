# Entry 4: ActiveRecord vs. SQL

## What is ActiveRecord

After perusing the topics for independent study offered, I concluded on **Databases**, although I've already decided on this topic a while ago when making my **[Doggo](https://github.com/josuemoran/doggo)** ruby game (this was a school project to create an interactive game within the console of ruby using classes). While making that game, I had thought how cool it would be to create an application where animal shelters can make accounts for their rescue animals and people in the area can set up play-dates with the pet to potentially adopt. I called this idea Match.com for dogs because I wanted to focus on dogs mainly.


## What is SQL

The name Puppr came from the idea of Match.com for dogs, when I randomly bounced names off of my peers, and Puppr seemed to fit. Although a generic play on the "r" added to company names to sound trendy (ex: Uber, Tinder, Giftr), I fell in love with the name Puppr and saw it as a viable product in the future.

### Pros:

## What I'm choosing for Puppr

### ActiveRecord takes the cake

I tried to follow this **[tutorial](http://mherman.org/blog/2013/06/08/designing-with-class-sinatra-plus-postgresql-plus-heroku/#.WNcu9Tvys2w)**, but not only did it have one or two syntax errors, it also seemed to be outdated! I ended up giving up halfway through because it just got too frustrating to continue. 

Instead, I found a YouTube video titled **["SQL for Beginners. Learn basics of SQL in 1 Hour"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Vtl2WggqOg)**, which ended up being a ripped **[Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/sql)** video uploaded on YouTube. I found this SO much more helpful than the tutorial code-along. Even though I didn't finish Khan Academy's video, I do see myself benefitting off of it a lot more in the future while building my Puppr app.

## Takeaways

1. When browsing for a tutorial, choose something that is at most **two** years old if it involves code. A lot can happen in two years.

2. Keep a mental, or physical, list of different app ideas that can solve mundane problems, or solve world hunger! (**[Google Keep](https://www.google.com/keep/)** is a personal favorite).

3. Don't let your frustration hold you back from what you think of in terms of programming. I spent 30 minutes on figuring out how to insert that image of the dog you saw earlier; I could have easily given up and forgotten about it, but that wouldn't have been fun. 
    > P.S. To embed an image for markdown it was `<img src="imageName.jpg"/>`, but C9 (my IDE) didn't want to display the image. It wasn't until I pushed to GitHub that my image showed up.
