# Entry 4: ActiveRecord vs. SQL

## What is ActiveRecord

To start off, ActiveRecord is a Library for Ruby for wroking with " Relational Databases" (relational databases are a collection of data items organized as a set of formally described tables). ActiveRecord provides Object Orientation Mapping, which essentially converts data between incompatible type systems in object-oriented programming languages.

It should also be noted that ActiveRecord is a Ruby on Rails framework, which means it was meant to be used on Rails.

ActiveRecord also creates the tables and "activley records" the data for the developer, making it easier to work with.

## What is SQL

To start off, an interesting fact about SQL is that it was originally named Sequel by the folks over at IBM, but being that the name was already copyrighted, they decided S-Q-L fit better, where it stands for Structured Query Language. Outside of the U.S it is common to hear S-Q-L compared to Sequel, since Sequel is an English word, and saying the letters are easier.

Back on track, SQL is used to communicate with databases and is the standard language for relational database managment systems(DBSM).
There are different itterations of SQL, such as MySQL and SQLite. The differneces being that MySQL is used for client server DBSM, which has more interactions with the Database servers. SQLite is more of an app-resident library. It is appropriate to use MySQL when building web-apps, being that it has more support for browsers, but SQLite has more support for languages.

## What I'm choosing for Puppr

### ActiveRecord takes the cake

Because it's simpler, and it was made to work on Ruby, being that it's a framework for Rails.


## Takeaways
Comparing different languages before you learn one will be extremely helpful in building your next web-app
